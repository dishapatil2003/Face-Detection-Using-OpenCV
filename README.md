# Face-Detection-Using-OpenCV

" This project demonstrates face detection in images and video streams using the OpenCV library. 
It utilizes the Haar Cascades classifier for detecting human faces in real-time or from static images,
all executed within a Jupyter Notebook environment.."

Features : -
       1) Real-time face detection using a webcam , 
       2) Face detection from image files , 
       3) Visualization of detected faces with bounding boxes , 
       4) Easy-to-follow steps for understanding the implementation of OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade Classifier in Python ...!!


Project Overview : -
The purpose of this project is to showcase the ability of OpenCV to perform face detection efficiently using pre-trained models. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook to make the steps clear and interactive, allowing users to experiment and modify the code as needed.

Technologies Used :- 
               1 . Python 3.x ,
               2 . OpenCV: A powerful library for real-time computer vision ,
               3 . Jupyter Notebook: An interactive coding environment that is perfect for step-by-step execution...!!

               
How It Works :- 

1 ) Face Detection Algorithm: The project uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascades classifier for face detection. This classifier is based on machine learning algorithms that detect objects (in this case, faces) in images.

2 ) Image/Video Input: You can either provide an image or capture real-time video from your webcam. The detected faces are then marked with bounding boxes for visualization.

3 ) Webcam or Static Images: The program can detect faces from both a webcam feed and static images, offering flexibility in use cases.
